# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project applies several machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics. The dataset includes critical clinical features like age, blood pressure, and troponin levels. The goal is to build a reliable model that can aid early diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals.
